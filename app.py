        ### **Welcome to the Legal Amazon Deforestation Interactive Report!**

        The Amazon Legal region covers about 59% of Brazil's territory and is home to one of the world's richest biodiversities.  
        Unfortunately, this area faces significant human pressure, especially from deforestation and wildfires, impacting climate, soil, and local communities.
        
        Because environmental sustainability is a topic I deeply care about, I chose to explore this challenge using data ‚Äî diving into satellite records, climate indicators, and land use patterns to produce a comprehensive and data-driven analysis in this report. Here, you will find:
        1. **Introduction**: Context about the Amazon Legal region and Report objectives.
        2. **Interactive Map** (coming soon): Visualization of yearly loss of forest cover.
        3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Charts and tables showing correlations, distributions, and historical patterns.
        4. **Machine Learning**: Predictive models to anticipate deforestation trends.

    The core dataset is based on the DETER deforestation alerts from INPE's TerraBrasilis platform, which provides georeferenced daily records of deforestation in the Legal Amazon.
    Additional environmental and anthropogenic factors‚Äîsuch as wildfire hotspots, rainfall, and land use were extracted from Google Earth Engine and stored in cloud buckets for local processing.
    
    After acquiring the raw data, I performed extensive ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) procedures:
    - Filtering and cleaning shapefiles for the Legal Amazon territory.
    - Aggregating data by day, month, and municipality.
    - Integrating multiple sources into a unified time-series dataset.

    Three rounds of regression-based models were developed to forecast short-term deforestation:
    - Baseline models: such as Lasso Regression and LightGBM with default parameters.
    - Tuned models: using pipelines and cross-validation for hyperparameter optimization.
    - Advanced setups: including early stopping, scaling, and model selection based on multiple performance metrics.

    The final models were evaluated using MAE, RMSE, and R¬≤ scores on temporal train-test splits, ensuring robustness and avoiding data leakage.

    The dataset used in this analysis comprises **3 165 daily observations** from the Brazilian Legal Amazon region. It includes four key variables identified as relevant drivers or indicators of deforestation:
    - **Deforestation Area (ha)**: daily area in hectares where forest cover was lost.
    - **Fires**: number of fire hotspots detected.
    - **Precipitation (mm)**: daily rainfall levels.
    - **Pasture Area (ha)**: annual pasture extent, assigned to each day to match the granularity of other variables.

    From the descriptive statistics, we observe a **highly skewed distribution** of deforestation events, with a median of 0 ha, indicating that most days record no official alerts, while some extreme cases surpass 435k ha in a single day.
    The presence of such outliers required careful normalization during data preprocessing.
    Similarly, the number of fire hotspots varies widely, ranging from 0 to 892 per day, with a mean of 82.65, reinforcing the episodic and spatially concentrated nature of wildfires in the region.
    
    The correlation matrix reveals some insights into the interdependence between environmental factors:
    - A **moderate positive correlatio**n is observed between the **number of fires and deforestation**, suggesting that fire activity often accompanies forest loss.
    - Precipitation shows a **moderate negative correlation** with fires and a weaker inverse relationship with deforestation, indicating that drier periods are more conducive to fire propagation and possibly to forest clearing operations.

    The annual aggregates displayed in the Report provide important temporal context of deforestation in the Legal Amazon.

    1. **Deforestation Area (ha/year)**
    Between 2016 and 2024, deforestation shows strong variability. A sharp increase is observed in 2020, likely related to political and enforcement changes during that period. After a drop in 2021, deforestation rose again, peaking in 2024. The drop in 2025 is partial and reflects incomplete data collection for that year.

    2. **Fire Incidence (hotspots/year)**
    The number of fire hotspots follows a similar yet noisier pattern, peaking in 2019 and 2024, closely matching deforestation surges. This alignment reinforces the hypothesis of a structural link between fire and forest clearing, as previously suggested in the correlation analysis.

    3. **Precipitation (mm/year)**
    Rainfall exhibits less interannual volatility, but the lowest precipitation values in 2016 and 2025 coincide with above-average deforestation years. Notably, the dry year of 2024, which recorded reduced rainfall compared to previous years, aligns with the peak in both fires and forest loss. This pattern supports the negative correlation between precipitation and fire incidence observed earlier.

    4. **Pasture Area (ha/day)**
    Pasture area presents a steady upward trend from 2016 to 2024, reflecting continued land conversion for livestock and agriculture. Its' cumulative growth over time may help explain the structural pressures on forest cover. The drop in 2025 is due to data unavailability rather than an actual reduction in pasture area.

    Understanding the distribution of each variable is a crucial step in preparing data for machine learning. It allows us to detect skewness, outliers, and scaling issues that can negatively affect model performance if not addressed.

    1. **Deforestation Area (ha/year)**
    The distribution is **highly right-skewed**, with the vast majority of observations clustered at or near **zero hectares**. A small number of extreme events represent very high values, which are likely tied to cumulative or delayed reporting in the DETER alert system. These extreme values have **high influence on the mean**.

    The main goal of this project is to **anticipate deforestation in the Brazilian Legal Amazon**, enabling earlier interventions and more effective policymaking. To achieve this, we developed predictive models capable of estimating short-term forest loss based on historical patterns and environmental drivers.

    However, before modeling, it was crucial to **prepare the data efficiently**. This involved:

    - **Transforming skewed variables** (e.g., deforestation area) using log transformation to stabilize variance;  
    - **Normalizing the features** to ensure comparability across different scales;  
    - **Engineering lag features** and rolling averages to capture temporal dependencies;  
    - **Managing outliers** that could bias learning, especially in fire and deforestation variables.

                **LightGBM with early stopping** achieved the smallest RMSE on the hold-out set (3.3602), while also maintaining the best R¬≤ (0.4147).

                Because the goal is to minimize RMSE (and maximize R¬≤), LightGBM (Advanced, Round 3) is the recommended model:

                1. **Best Accuracy**  
                - Its RMSE of 3.3602 is the lowest among all model+round combinations.
                2. **Strong Explanatory Power**  
                - R¬≤ of 0.4147 means it explains about 41% of the variance on unseen data.
                3. **Speed & Flexibility**  
                - LightGBM trains relatively quickly and handles non-linear patterns well.  
                - Early stopping in Round 3 also prevents overfitting, making the model more robust.
                
                **In conclusion, LightGBM with early stopping** produces the lowest RMSE and highest R¬≤, making it the best all-around pick for forecasting Amazon deforestation under this pipeline.
